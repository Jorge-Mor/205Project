## Future Work:
  - In terms of the future of this project we want to be able to display more information about the movies we are displaying. 
  - We also wanted to get a second part of the website where the user can "save" these images and later manipulate them as they please. 
  - Our last idea was to show not just once movie when a movie is searched but everyone movie that shares a similar name in case the user does not exactly know the name of the movie they are looking for
